# Snake-Game

This is a remake of the classic arcade game.  The rules are simples, use the arrow keys to navigate the white snake to get the blue dot (aka 'food') on the screen.  But be careful!  If the snake touches the edge of the screen or touches it tail then the game is over.  How would the snake touch it's tail?  Well everytime the snake gets the food, it will grow in length.  Also when the snake gets the food, the user get's 1 point.  When the game is over then the score resets to 0.  The blank data.txt is used to keep track of high scores.  Enjoy!!!
